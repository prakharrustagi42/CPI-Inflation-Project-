2. Transportation is the smallest Contributor to the CPI Calculation.
3. Rural Population spends more on Medical and Apparels than Urban population

**(B) Y-O-Y Inflation**
1. 2022 has the highest inflation rate for the period of 2017-2023											 

**(C) Food And Bev Basket Inflation**
1. For overall food and beverage basket , the month on month inflation rate reached it's highest in June 2022							
2. Top 3 contributors to the inflation observed are : Meat and Fish , Spices and finally Prepared Meals , snacks , sweets etc.					

**(D) Covid Impact Analysis**
1.FOOD AND BEVERAGE - INFLATION SPIKE DURING LOCKDOWN(Mar20-APR20)		- Panic buying and hoarding led to temporary shortages and price hikes for food and beverage Category

4. Transportaion Basket had the **correlation coefficient of 0.6 with curde oil** priec fluctuation.		

Excel remains a relevant and indispensable tool for both big and small companies due to its powerful data analysis capabilities, ease of use, and versatility in handling complex tasks.

In this project, I harnessed the power of Excel to transform raw data into insightful and actionable information.

Here's a snapshot of the process :
𝟏. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Removing duplicates,replacement of inaccurate and misleading values.
𝟐. 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Formulas such as VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, and CORREL to perform complex calculations, data retrievals.
𝟑. 𝐏𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬: Pivot tables to summarize large data sets and generate interactive charts for a clear visual representation of trends and patterns.
𝟒. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Designed dashboards using Excel charts (line, bar, pie) and conditional formatting to highlight key metrics and insights at a glance.

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:

In India, the 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒎𝒆𝒓 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒆 𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒙 (𝑪𝑷𝑰) is used to measure inflation, and it involves a fixed basket of goods and services. This basket is comprehensive and includes a wide array of items that an average Indian consumer uses. These items are not limited to just food and clothing but extend to transportation, medical care, electricity, education, and almost every other category that involves expenditure of money. 

My efforts in this project majorly focused on the following:

𝟏) 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: Contribution of different broader categories (food, energy, transportation, education, etc.) towards the CPI calculations.
𝟐) 𝐘-𝐎-𝐘 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Graph depicting the growth rate Y-o-Y and identify the year with the highest inflation rate. Highlighting the reason why the year had the highest inflation (based on research).
𝟑) 𝐂𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:  How the onset and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic affected inflation rates in India. Impact of key pandemic milestones (first lockdown, unlock 1, etc.) on the CPI inflation %.
𝟒) 𝐂𝐫𝐮𝐝𝐞 𝐨𝐢𝐥 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: How major global economic events (like imported crude oil price fluctuations) have influenced India's inflation. Crude oil price data was taken from Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell for 2021-2023.
